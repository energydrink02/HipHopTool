Tool for working with HIP/HOP archive files.
Currently the program can extract the files contained in the archives to different folders based on their extension.

Games which I know that uses these archives:

*Scooby Doo: Night of 100 Frights

*Spongebob Squarepants: Battle for Bikini Bottom

*The Incredibles Game

*The Spongebob Squarepants Movie Game
